# Plagiarism Detection in Source Code

## Description
This project aims to develop an advanced plagiarism detection system for source code, focusing on Python and C++. Traditional plagiarism detection methods often fail to identify subtle modifications, such as variable renaming, function reordering, and restructuring of loops. This project leverages deep learning techniques, particularly CodeGPT and CodeBERT, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of plagiarism detection.

## Features
- It can detect plagiarism of Python Code.
- It can detect plagiarism of C++ Code.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face authorization token for model.

### Install Dependencies
To set up the environment, you can use the following steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Madhusudan-Verma/NLP_Project.git
2.Change the directory for dataset \
3.Put the hugging face token .\
4.Run the jupyter notebook file.
